Elliptic: 

“Stopping Illicit Transaction Activity To Secure The Future Of Cryptocurrencies”

## Overview and Origin
Elliptic is the leading provider of crypto-asset risk management solutions for crypto businesses and financial solutions (Elliptic, n.d.). The three main services Elliptic provides are auditable proof to comply with anti-money laundering regulations, actionable intelligence for cryptocurrency investigators, and powering financial crimes investigation teams (Elliptic).

In October 2013, Dr. James Smith, Dr. Tom Robminson and Dr. Adam Joyce launched the first cryptocurrency risk intelligence company, Elliptic (Elliptic, n.d.).

Not knowing much about the industry needs, the first product  Elliptic offered a cryptocurrency wallet, the Elliptic Vault in 2014 (Butcher, 2016).  In an article with TechCrunch, the CEO and co-founder James Smith stated “We’re a startup, and you have to look around and see what the industry’s doing and find what you’re best suited to. When we first looked at Bitcoin we saw it both from the financial point of view, but also the technical point of view. And saw that there was going to be something to this.” (Butcher) Having more experience in the cryptocurrency industry, the co-founders took note of the concurrent difficulties in confidently tracing the source and the destination of blockchain transactions. Their belief that transactions through cryptocurrencies should remain transparent, led them to develop a means to disrupt illicit blockchain activity (Elliptic). 

As a response to the compliance needs, Elliptic launched the first cryptocurrency risk intelligence tool in June 2015. In 2016, Elliptic expanded its customer focus to US law enforcements and some european agencies (Lomas, 2016). 

According to TechCrunch, Elliptic technology works by tracing transactions through the public Bitcoin ledger by creating a template of linkages (Lomas, 2016). From there Elliptic is able to find a suspicious series of transactions using the pattern-spotting technology. The pattern is first identified by a customer’s compliance officer. With the data collected by the compliance officer, Elliptic’s machine learning a;gorithms then use that data to spot variations and multiple instances of the same patterns. Overtime Elliptic, has been able to find how transactions are associated with entities.  The primary focus is finding criminal entities. Bitcoin is a way to move large amounts of money with low costs and low friction so it will always have sine attraction.
