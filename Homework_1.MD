# Elliptic

## Overview and Origin:
Launched in October 2013, Dr. James Smith, Dr. Tom Robminson, and Dr. Adam Joyce co-founded the first cryptocurrency risk intelligence company, Elliptic (Elliptic, n.d.). In 2014, Octopus Investments provided $2 million in capital for Elliptic’s first cryptocurrency wallet, Elliptic Vault (Butcher, 2016). After launching the Elliptic Vault, Elliptic soon learned that there was a market for regulation technology. In an interview with TechCrunch, the CEO and co-founder James Smith stated “We started with a problem, and the technology came next. The first product was for companies in the Bitcoin space who are transacting a lot of Bitcoin — so it’s the exchanges, payment providers and so on. They’ve got a responsibility to satisfy regulation. That’s particular in the States and in Europe where AML [anti-money laundering] regulation is more strict. And it’s particularly for the larger and better funded companies who have the most regulatory scrutiny.”(Butcher). Having more experience in the cryptocurrency industry, the co-founders took note of the concurrent difficulties in confidently tracing the source and the destination of blockchain transactions. Their belief that transactions through cryptocurrencies should remain transparent, led them to develop a means to disrupt illicit blockchain activity (Elliptic, n.d.). 
Today, Elliptic is the leading provider of crypto-asset risk management solutions for crypto businesses and financial solutions (Markets Insider, n.d.).  According to the Owler, Elliptic has received $39 million in funding. Elliptic continues to provide auditable proof to comply with anti-money laundering regulations, and intelligence services for cryptocurrency investigators and financial crimes investigation teams (Elliptic, n.d.). 

## Business Activities:
According to TechCrunch, Elliptic technology works by tracing transactions through the public Bitcoin ledger by creating a template of linkages. From there Elliptic is able to find a suspicious series of transactions using the pattern-spotting technology. In which the pattern is first identified by a customer’s compliance officer. Elliptic's machine learning algorithms then use that data to spot variations and multiple instances of the same patterns. Overtime, Elliptic has been able to find how transactions are associated with entities. (Lomas, 2016). 
    The customer base Elliptic provides its services to banks and other financial institutions that are obligated to comply with anti-money laundering regulations, cryptocurrency institutions, and government agencies (Elliptic, n.d.). 
With the growing cryptocurrency transactions, it is becoming more difficult to confidently trace the source and destination of funds (Elliptic, n.d.). Consequently, financial professionals are faced with the challenge of identifying fraud and complying with anti-money laundering regulations (Elliptic). Through  Elliptic specialized cybercrime services and blockchain methods, banks are able to meet AML cryptocurrency requirements and identify fraudulent accounts (Elliptic).                    
Elliptic states on their website that there is a  growing trend of illicit goods being traded on the dark web with cryptocurrencies as the primary means of exchange (Elliptic, n.d.). Through forensic software, Elliptic is able to systematically trace and unmask pseudonymous and anonymous cryptocurrencies by linking digital identities to real-world profiles (Elliptic). Top law enforcement agencies use Elliptic’s software to investigate bitcoin roles in cases of narcotics distribution, child pornography, and ransomeware (Elliptic).
In an interview with TechCrunch, the CEO of Elliptic named Chainalysis as its main competitor in the industry (Butcher, 2016). Much like Chainalysis, Elliptic offers regulatory compliance services. However, for security measures, Elliptic only reports user risks files to the customer and does not share that report with every party involved in the transaction (Prisco, 2019). 
According to Stackshare, the applications Elliptic uses are php nginx, and bootstrap (Stackshare, n.d.).


## Landscape:
Elliptic is a crypto-asset risk management firm and has been named by Builtin as one of the top 12 RegTech firms to know(Daley, 2019). The other companies listed alongside Elliptic were: Chainalysis, ComplyAdvantage,Ascent Regtech, Forter, Hummingbird, Continuity, Trunomi, Ayasdi, IdentiyMind, Sift Science, and BehavioSec (Daley).
According to an article by the European Securities and Market Authority, RegTech has reshaped compliance services since the “Great Financial Crisis.” The services produced in the RegTech space offer a cost efficient compliance solution that can be utilized in the financial industry (Armstrong, 2017). 

## Results:
Based on the information provided by Craft, Elliptic’s metric for success is the number of clients served. In the TechCrunch report in 2019, Elliptic started out with 10-20 clients (Lomas, 2019). Today, in Craft’s breakdown of Elliptic’s financials and metrics, Elliptic has 100 customers (Craft, n.d.).  

## Recommendations:
Understanding the importance of securing personal information and the growing use of cryptocurrency in the healthcare industry, I believe that there is a market for Elliptic’s crypto-asset risk management services. Based on a global study conducted by IBM and Ponemon Institute, in 2017 the average cost of a data breach to major companies was $3.62 million (Arnold, 2017). According to the Department of Justice, during the 2016-2017 fiscal year, they were able to recover $2 billion in fraudulent practices (Jacobs, 2019). The benefit of utilizing crypto-currency risk management and blockchain technology in the healthcare sector, has the potential to protect patient information, healthcare institution’s transactions, and minimize healthcare fraud. According to PR Newswire, the global blockchain market will increase by 70% from 2020-2027 (Market, 2020). I believe Elliptic’s customizable software, security policies, and experience in crypto-currency risk management, attractive to healthcare companies that are incorporating blockchain technology in their businesses.
